	<GR_SafetyDesc>Safety is a number that gets deducted from the Failed outcome chance. For example, safety 5 reduces the risk of the failed outcome by 5% (from 10% to 5%). This value can also be negative, increasing the risk of a failed experiment.</GR_SafetyDesc>
	<GR_StabilityDesc>Stability is a number that gets deducted from the swap chance. For example, stability 5 means that the base chance of the genes swapping turns from 10% to 5% (becoming more stable). This value can also be negative, which will mean the chance of genomes swapping their positions and resulting in an unwanted hybrid are larger.</GR_StabilityDesc>
	<GR_TimeMultiplierDesc>Time multiplier accelerates or increases the time taken by the genomorpher to complete its task. A fractional modifier accelerates the process (for example 0.5 means it will take half the usual time), while a modifier larger than 1 slows it down (2 means it will take double the time).</GR_TimeMultiplierDesc>
