		<label>organic honeycomb</label>
		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by organic bees. Organic bees are genetically modified bees that extract cellulose fibers from nearby plants and convert it into a slurry of genetic material which can be refined into template genomes. The main use of these bees, however, is to hybridize them with other bees to create genetic bees of different subspecies. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get honey, beeswax and template genomes.</description>
